# Overview
I created this software to begin working with TypeScript. In this project I created a a fetching function to retrieve the html off of a website. I ended up pulling html from 2 former website projects. I then used Node.js to compile the Typescipt into Javascript. Finally I used Node.js to run the JavaScript that was compiled. Overall my purpose was to start working with Typescipt and Node.js and to practice what I have learned so far.

# Development Environment
*Node.js 20.11.0 LTS *Typescript 5.3 *Visual Studio Code *Git/Github *JavaScript 

# Useful Websites

- [Node.js website used to download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [W3schools website used to learn about Typescript](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_casting.php)
- [Typescript website used to learn about async functions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notestypescript-1-7.html)

# Future Work

- Change it so it pulls usefull information instead of just the html of old projects. 
- Figure out node and see if i need to keep Node_modules file and also the Package-lock.json file. 
- Add in ES lint and fix all the problems with the code.
